1. Product Backlog & Sprint Planning

The project tasks are divided into multiple sprints, each focusing on specific functional requirements.

Sprint Tasks
Sprint-1 – Data Collection

User Story: Load data into the processing environment

Story Points: 1

Priority: High

Sprint-2 – Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values

Encode or map categorical variables

Story Points: 3, 2

Priority: Medium

Sprint-3 – Model Development

Build initial model using processed data

Story Points: 5

Priority: High

Sprint-4 – Visualization & Dashboard

Create graphs and visualizations

Design dashboard and story interface

Story Points: 6

Priority: High

Sprint-5 – Documentation

Prepare step-by-step project documentation

Story Points: 7

Priority: Medium

These sprint tasks and user stories are outlined in the planning table on pages 1–2.

2. Project Tracker & Sprint Schedule

Each sprint is planned with:

Total Story Points: 20

Duration: 1 Day per sprint

Planned and actual release dates tracked

Team participation across all tasks

The tracker table on page 3 shows the sprint timeline from 24 June 2025 to 28 June 2025.

3. Velocity & Burndown Planning

Team velocity helps measure productivity and estimate delivery timelines.

Velocity Calculation

Average Velocity (AV) formula:

AV = Sprint Duration / Velocity
Example shown in the document:
AV = 20 / 10 = 2 story points per day

This calculation, illustrated at the bottom of page 3, helps evaluate sprint performance and workload distribution.
