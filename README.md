Project Phases

1. Ideation Phase

The ideation phase focused on understanding user needs and defining the problem.

Brainstorming & Idea Generation

Collaborative idea creation using “How Might We” statements

Prioritization based on feasibility and impact

Structured problem exploration sessions

Brainstorming & Idea Generation

Problem Statements

Two primary users were identified:

Policymaker

Needs clear insights into economic prosperity

Existing indices are complex and outdated

Economic Researcher

Needs reliable datasets for correlation analysis

Current data sources are fragmented

These structured statements guide solution development.

Define Problem Statements

Empathy Mapping

Empathy maps helped analyze:

User thoughts and emotions

Pain points and goals

Behavior and expectations

This ensured a user-centered solution design.
