Project Design Phase – Solution Definition
Measuring the Pulse of Prosperity: An Index of Economic Freedom Analysis
Overview

This phase defines how the proposed system solves real-world challenges faced by policymakers and researchers. It includes the problem–solution alignment, proposed solution details, and system architecture used to build a scalable economic freedom analysis platform.

1. Problem – Solution Fit

The Problem–Solution Fit ensures that the developed solution directly addresses user pain points and improves decision-making processes.

Purpose

Identify customer problems and behaviors

Align solution features with real user needs

Improve adoption through effective communication strategies

Increase trust by solving frequent or complex issues

The template on page 1 explains how understanding behavioral patterns helps design effective solutions for target users.

Problem – Solution Fit

Key Outcomes

Clear mapping between problems and proposed solutions

Better communication and marketing strategies

Improved user engagement and solution adoption
